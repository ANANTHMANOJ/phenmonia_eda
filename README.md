Project from team AvengersOfAiMl


Our objective is to build a model which takes a CXR image as input and
attempts to find potentially infected-area and predicts the position of box/boxes
bounding the infected area. Automating Pneumonia screening in chest
radiographs, providing affected area details through bounding box.Assist
physicians to make better clinical decisions or even replace human judgment in
certain functional areas of healthcare (eg, radiology). Guided by relevant clinical
questions, powerful AI techniques can unlock clinically relevant information
hidden in the massive amount of data, which in turn can assist clinical decision
making.
